# Ansible role to deploy Odoo server docker from [Tecnativa](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-odoo-base)

This role allows you to deploy and start 2 Odoo docker instances on your server : a production instance (in /home/docker/odoo) and a test instance (in /home/docker/odootest/).

You would most probably need to adapt the files in the files/ and templates/ directories to your needs, the ones you find here are the ones used by Le Filament on a small VPS server.

On top of deploying and starting the Odoo instances, the following functionalities are added:
- automatic bank statement retrieval nightly (using an homemade [Weboob](http://weboob.org) docker and cron jobs to run it every night for each bank account)
- backup and restore based on duplicity docker from [Tecnativa](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-duplicity) which has been customized for our needs to backup on NFS directory and running it every night using cron, keeping only the latest week incremental backups for 1 month

Prior to running this role, you would need to have docker installed on your server and a traefik proxy (which is the purpose of [this role](https://github.com/remi-filament/ansible_role_docker_server))

This role is not foreseen to be used on a development environment (which is the purpose of [that role](https://github.com/remi-filament/docker_odoo_dev))

In order to use this role, you would need to define the following variables for your server (in hostvars for instance) - Only the names of the variables are provided below (not the values) for these used by this role to properly configure everything, and some examples for list of modules, you may copy this file directly in hostvars and set the variable although we could only encourage you to use an Ansible vault and refer vault variables from here:

# Procedure to restore Odoo from backup

In order to restore Owncloud database and files from backup, it is necessary to first delete the database (from Odoo interface URL/web/database/manager) then change directory to /home/docker/backups and run the following command:
```docker-compose -f backup-odoo.yaml run --rm backup_odoo sh -c "restore --force && createdb -T template0 \$PGDATABASE && pg_restore -d \$PGDATABASE \$SRC/\$PGDATABASE.pgdump"```


You can also copy production database inside test one, first delete the database from test instance (from Odoo test interface URL/web/database/manager) then change directory to /home/docker/backups and run the following command:
```docker-compose -f restore-odootest.yaml run --rm restore_test```
